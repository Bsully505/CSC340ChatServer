# CSC340ChatServer
# Jack Zemlanicky: worked on ChatClient.java- added protocol and functionality for changing usernames, room names, window close functionality, and commented the code to further describe what each method does. Added  dialog boxes to handle user errors when choosing their name and room name. Also assisted Dylan with the initial establishment of connection for the client to the server.
# Dylan: Worked on ChatClient.java- created establishConnection and recieveServerMsg methods. The establishConnection method does exactly what it's name suggests, begins the connection to the server (ChatSever). The recieveServerMsg method takes the server's output and relays it onto the clients GUI in a neat, readable, fashion. Also assisted Jack with the username and room name changing functionality.
